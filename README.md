another thing important that will make life easier is address reservation which allow you to control your device ip and stopping it from changing, if not you will need to check what is your pc ip to access the webui on the android browser


<img width="1257" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9976d6a6-febe-41fa-a6fc-73afc1641575" />


you need to search for your routermodel or calling someone with experiance to change the setting, its easy to do if you found it it allows your pc to keep the same ip and belive me its needed 



## THE WEBUI

 you can access the webui on your devices as phones by opening any browser and typing your pc adress (you can find it by typing (ipconfig) in the cmd it will be under the ip4) your adress should\not look like mine which is 192.168.0.106, then in the search box you type only your address the you put : then the port which is 8080 and the search box should look like this http://192.168.0.106:8080/ and click run, if every thing is ok will show you this
